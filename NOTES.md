# LangGraph & GraphRunner surprises (M3)

Things that were not obvious from the docs but bit me in M3.

## 1. Cancelling the consumer propagates into the awaited-turn's frame, not into a separate task

When `GraphRunner._consume` is suspended at `await self._current_turn` and
something calls `self._consumer.cancel()`, Python raises `CancelledError` **inside
`_consume` at that `await` line** — not inside `_current_turn`. The turn task
keeps running to completion unless it, too, is cancelled.

The first draft had a single `except asyncio.CancelledError: continue` around the
await, which meant a benign shutdown `cancel()` got mistaken for an interrupt,
the consumer swallowed it, and the loop kept running forever on the next
`in_queue.get()`. Fix: `mark_interrupted()` sets a flag; the except clause
`continue`s only when the flag is set, otherwise re-raises.

## 2. `out_queue.put` happening inside `_run_turn` creates a visible state-read race

Original `_run_turn` did `await out_queue.put(response)` **before returning** to
`_consume`, which then did `self.state = new_state`. Tests that read
`out_queue.get()` and then `runner.state` saw stale state — the producer had
published before the state was committed. Moving the `put` into `_consume`
(after `self.state = new_state`) removes the race: the caller sees the response
only after state is committed, guaranteed by single-threaded asyncio semantics.

General rule: publish-to-observer *must* follow state commit, not precede it.

## 3. LangGraph's `MemorySaver` is a smell, not a feature, for a single process

Every LangGraph tutorial adds `MemorySaver()` to `compile()`. For a single-process
voice agent where state is already held in `GraphRunner.state`, the checkpointer
is pure overhead — it serializes state on every step, adds thread_id plumbing to
`ainvoke` config, and obscures the failure modes (e.g., a stuck call's state now
lives in two places). Dropped it entirely. If we ever need resume-after-crash,
we'll add Postgres-backed checkpointing deliberately — not out of cargo culting.

## 4. TypedDict with `total=False` + pyright basic mode forces `.get()` at every read

`CallState(TypedDict, total=False)` is fine for handler returns (partial
updates), but pyright reports `reportTypedDictNotRequiredAccess` on every
`state["key"]` read. Options: (a) split into a "required" core and an "optional"
tail, (b) use `.get()` everywhere. Picked (b) for M3 — it's uglier at call sites
but keeps the schema single-source-of-truth. May revisit if it gets noisy in M4
when the Pipecat adapter reads from state.

## 5. Dispatcher pattern > chained conditional edges for a "one turn = one ainvoke" loop

First instinct was to wire `auth → patient_id → extract_benefits → …` as a chain
of `add_conditional_edges`, with each handler routing to the next node. That
works for batch execution but breaks the runner model: one `ainvoke` ends up
running *multiple* turns inside a single user-utterance cycle, making interrupt
cancellation semantics fuzzy (which handler was mid-flight when the user talked
over us?).

Dispatcher pattern: entry point is a trivial `dispatcher` node; a conditional
edge reads `state["current_node"]` and routes to exactly one handler node, which
returns `{"current_node": <next_node>, ...}` and goes straight to `END`. Next
`ainvoke` re-enters dispatcher, reads the new `current_node`, routes to the next
handler. Clean 1-to-1 mapping: one user turn → one `ainvoke` → one handler ran.
